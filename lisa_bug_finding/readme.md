# LISA Bug Finding Evidence
This directory contains the proof-of-concept test cases generated by LISA that successfully detected real-world functional bugs.
### Methodology
To evaluate LISA's fault detection capability, we reproduced 20 historical functional bugs (5 per library for 4 libraries) by reverting the source code to specific buggy commits.
The test generation process consisted of two stages:
- API Sequence Generation: We used the API sequences generated by LISA-1 within a 3-hour time budget.
- Invariant Insertion: We then applied LISA-2 to insert invariants into these sequences, producing the final executable unit tests.

These finalized tests were then executed against the vulnerable library versions to check for functional deviations.
### Results
LISA successfully detected 10 out of 20 injected bugs (50% detection rate). The corresponding bug-triggering test cases are organized by library in this directory.
**How to Verify the Bugs**
Each test case file is named after the Commit Hash of the bug it detects (e.g., d443f0a.cc). This hash corresponds to the specific commit in the official repository where the bug was originally fixed or reported.
**Verification Steps**
To verify the nature of a detected bug, you can inspect the commit history using the following URL pattern:
```Bash
https://github.com/<library_owner>/<library_name>/commit/<commit_hash>
```
Example
```bash
For the test case sqlite3/d443f0a.cc:
Bug ID / Commit Hash: d443f0a
Verification URL:
https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commit/d443f0a
```
This URL directs to the diff showing the fix for the bug that LISA successfully reproduced.
