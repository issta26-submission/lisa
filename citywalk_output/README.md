# CityWalk Output - Baseline Comparison

This directory contains the test cases generated by **CityWalk**, a state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tool, used as a baseline for comparison in our evaluation.

## About CityWalk

CityWalk is an automated test generation approach that leverages Large Language Models to generate unit tests for C/C++ libraries. It represents the current state-of-the-art in LLM-driven test synthesis.

## Directory Structure

Each subdirectory corresponds to a library evaluated in our experiments:
- `cJSON/` - Test cases for the cJSON library
- `lcms/` - Test cases for the Little-CMS color management library
- `libpcap/` - Test cases for the libpcap packet capture library
- `libpng/` - Test cases for the libpng image library
- `re2/` - Test cases for the RE2 regular expression library
- `sqlite/` - Test cases for the SQLite database library
- `zlib/` - Test cases for the zlib compression library

## Test Case Format

Each `.cpp` file represents a single generated test case with the naming convention:
```
<source_file>_<function_name>_<line_number>_test.cpp
```

For example:
- `cJSON_c_cJSON_AddArrayToObject_2230_test.cpp` - Tests the `cJSON_AddArrayToObject` function from cJSON.c

## Experimental Setup

- **Generation Method**: CityWalk's default configuration
- **Target Coverage**: Function-level coverage across library APIs
- **Time Budget**: Equivalent to LISA's experimental time budget

## Purpose

These outputs serve as a baseline to:
1. Compare the test quality between LISA and existing LLM-based approaches
2. Assess bug detection capability
3. Benchmark generation efficiency

## Notes

- All test cases were generated using CityWalk's original implementation
- Test cases may include both successfully compiled and failed attempts (depending on CityWalk's output format)
- Bug detection metrics are reported in the main paper
