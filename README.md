# LISA Experimental Results

This repository contains the complete experimental artifacts and results for the LISA (LLM-based Intelligent Sequence-Aware Fuzzing) research project.

## 📁 Directory Overview

### Core Experimental Results

- **[lisa/](lisa/)** - The main LISA framework implementation (source code, build scripts, and configurations)
- **[LISA_full_coverage/](LISA_full_coverage/)** - Complete coverage results from LISA-1 across all 7 evaluated libraries (3-hour time budget)
- **[lisa_bug_finding/](lisa_bug_finding/)** - Bug-triggering test cases generated by LISA that detected real-world functional bugs

### Baseline Comparisons

- **[ossfuzz_coverage_result/](ossfuzz_coverage_result/)** - OSS-Fuzz baseline coverage reports 
- **[ossfuzz_bug_finding/](ossfuzz_bug_finding/)** - Bug-triggering cases discovered by OSS-Fuzz (
- **[citywalk_output/](citywalk_output/)** - Test cases generated by CityWalk (state-of-the-art LLM-based test generator)
- **[rawlllm_coverage/](rawlllm_coverage/)** - Results from using raw LLM without LISA framework (demonstrates LISA's value-add)

### Ablation Study

- **[ablation_study/](ablation_study/)** - Ablation study results evaluating the contribution of each LISA component (examples, repair, rules)
