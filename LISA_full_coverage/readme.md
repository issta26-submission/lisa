# LISA Full Coverage Results
This directory contains the experimental artifacts generated by LISA-1 across the 7 evaluated libraries. For each library, we provide the complete corpus of successful test seeds generated within the 3-hour time budget, along with their corresponding coverage reports.

### Directory Structure
Each library subdirectory contains:
- seeds/: The directory containing  successfully compiled and executed C++ test cases (.cc files).
- result.txt: The detailed coverage metrics (line, function, and branch coverage) generated by llvm-cov.
- log.txt: The execution log summarizing the generation statistics (e.g., total attempts, compilation success seeds, execution success seeds).
  
### Note on Execution Logs
Please note that for some libraries, the log.txt file contains only the final statistical summary rather than the full verbose generation trace. This is due to log truncation or storage constraints during the experimental runs. However, all critical metrics required to verify the compilation and execution success rates reported in the paper are preserved in the summary section of each log file. The provided seeds and coverage_report.txt serve as the primary evidence for reproducibility.

### Note on Seed Count Discrepancy (Corpus Minimization)

You may observe that the number of files in the seeds/ directory is sometimes lower than the "successful seeds" count recorded in the logs. This is intentional.
To maintain a high-quality and compact test suite, we applied a coverage-based deduplication strategy (similar to afl-cmin). Seeds in some libraries that achieved identical coverage profiles to existing ones were filtered out during the post-processing phase.
