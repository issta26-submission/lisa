# OSS-Fuzz Baseline Coverage Reports
This directory contains the coverage summary reports generated by OSS-Fuzz for the 7 evaluated libraries. These reports serve as the baseline for RQ1 (Code Coverage Analysis).

### Experimental Setup
- Time Budget: 3 hours (consistent with LISA's time).
- Fuzzing Engine: libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer (ASan).
- Target Versions: The libraries were compiled from the same major versions as the Lisa experiments (minor commit differences may exist due to OSS-Fuzz build integration).

### File Structure
For each library (e.g., sqlite3, zlib), we provide the `{library_name}.json` file extracted from the final fuzzing campaign.
### How to Read the Report
Each JSON file contains the merged coverage metrics:
- lines_percent: Line coverage percentage.
- functions_percent: Function coverage percentage.
- branches_percent: Branch coverage percentage.
### Example
```c
{"merged": {
    "branch": "current",
    "lines_covered": 29275,
    "lines_total": 82734,
    "lines_percent": 35.384485217685594, <-- Compare this with Lisa's Line Coverage
    "functions_covered": 1267,
    "functions_total": 2722,
    "functions_percent": 46.54665686994856, 
    "branches_covered": 10623,
    "branches_total": 39948,
    "branches_percent": 26.592069690597775  <-- Compare this with Lisa's Branch Coverage
  }}
